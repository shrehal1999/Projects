This is a classification model made by using Naive Bayes algorithm.
Project is based on natural learning process.
The model is trained on dataset of kaggle in which a we have provided with customers reviews and ratings about yelp restaurant.
We have ratings from 1 star to 5 star with their corrosponding reviews.
Model will classify a input review to either 1 star or 5 star rating by doing text processing and training on Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
We used 80% of data that is reviews with either 1 or 5 star rating as training data and 20% for testing.
The accuracy of model comes out to be 93%.
