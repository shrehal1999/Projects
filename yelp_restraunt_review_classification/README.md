# Yelp Restaurant Review Classification
This project is based on natural learning processing in which our machine learning model classifies a particular review of a restaurant as either 1 star or 5 star.

# Text processing
- Text prepocessing was done using the nltk and regex libraries of python.
- All punctuations, stop words were removed and finally lemmatization was performed.
- length of a review was found to be a significant feature in explorartory data analysis.
- Vectorization of word tokens was performed using tf-idf transformer.

# Machine learning
- Naive Bayes classifier was used for classification of reviews.
- After a bit of hyper paramter tuning it produced results with 93% accuracy.
