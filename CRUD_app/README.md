# Stack Information
The app is written in Python on top of the Flask micro-framework. The front-end was built using, an easy to use HTML, CSS and JS front-end library that looks clean out the box. Sqlite was implemented as the database of choice, in conjunction with the SQLAlchemy ORM to simplify CRUD operations.
