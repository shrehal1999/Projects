# Basic CRUD flask app for managing employees

A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) employee management Flask app loosely based off the https://codeloop.org/flask-crud-application-with-sqlalchemy/ tutorial.

# Stack Information
The app is written in Python on top of the Flask micro-framework. The front-end was built using, an easy to use HTML, CSS and JS front-end library that looks clean out the box. Sqlite was implemented as the database of choice, in conjunction with the SQLAlchemy ORM to simplify CRUD operations.

# List of features
The following are the main high-level features available through the app:
- Administrators can create, update, and delete employee info.
- Data Analysis can be performed over the employees data after fetching it from the local sqlite database.
- Administrators view all employees and their details.
- Helpful error, warning and success messages help the user to navigate effectively throughout form completion stages of the app.
